Python Numbers
There are three numeric types in Python:

int
float
complex

Variables of numeric types are created when you assign a value to them:

Example

x = 1    
  # inty = 2.8  # floatz = 1j   # complex


To verify the type of any object in Python, use the type() function:

Example

  print(type(x))print(type(y))print(type(z))

Int
Int, or integer, is a whole number, 
positive or negative, without decimals, of unlimited length.

Example
Integers:

x = 1y = 35656222554887711z = 
  -3255522print(type(x))print(type(y))print(type(z))

Float
Float, or "floating point number" is a number, positive or negative, containing one or more decimals.

Example
Floats:

x = 1.10y = 1.0z = -35.59print(type(x))print(type(y))print(type(z))

Float can also be scientific numbers with an "e" to indicate the power of 10.

Example
Floats:

  x = 35e3y = 12E4z = -87.7e100print(type(x))print(type(y))
  print(type(z))

Complex
Complex numbers are written with a "j" as the imaginary part:

Example
Complex:

  x = 3+5jy = 5jz = -5jprint(type(x))print(type(y))
  print(type(z))

Type Conversion
You can convert from one type to another with the int(), 
float(), and complex() methods:

Example
Convert from one type to another:

  x = 1    # inty = 2.8  # floatz = 1j   # complex#convert from int to float:
  a = float(x)#convert from float to int:
  b = int(y)#convert from int to complex:c = complex(x)print(a)print(b)
  print(c)print(type(a))print(type(b))
  print(type(c))

Note: You cannot convert complex numbers into another number type.


Random Number
Python does not have a random() function to 
make a random number, but Python has a built-in module called
random that can be used to make random numbers:

Example
Import the random module, and display a random number between 1 and 9:

  import randomprint(random.randrange(1, 10))
