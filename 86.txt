String Format
As we learned in the Python Variables chapter, we cannot combine strings and numbers like this:

Example

  age = 36txt = "My name is John, I am " + ageprint(txt)

But we can combine strings and numbers by using the format() method!
The format() method takes the passed arguments, 
formats them, and places them in the string where the placeholders
{} are:

Example
Use the format() method to insert numbers 
into strings:

  age = 36txt = "My name is John, and I am {}"print(txt.format(age))

The format() method takes unlimited number of arguments, and are placed into 
the respective placeholders:

Example

  quantity = 3itemno = 567price = 49.95myorder = "I want {} 
  pieces of item {} for {} dollars."print(myorder.format(quantity, 
  itemno, price))

Try it Yourself »

You can use index numbers {0} to be sure the arguments are placed 
in the correct placeholders:

Example

  quantity = 3itemno = 567price = 49.95myorder = "I want to pay {2} 
  dollars for {0} pieces of item {1}."print(myorder.format(quantity, 
  itemno, price))
