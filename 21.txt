Create a Bookmark in HTML
Bookmarks can be useful if a web page is very long.
To create a bookmark - first create the bookmark, then add a link 
to it.
When the link is clicked, the page will scroll down or up to the location with the 
bookmark.

bookmark:


<h2 id="C4">Chapter 4</h2>

Then, add a link to the bookmark ("Jump to Chapter 4"), from within the same page:

 <a href="#C4">Jump to Chapter 4</a>
