Escape Character
To insert characters that are illegal in a string, use an escape character.
An escape character is a backslash \ followed by the character you want to insert.
An example of an illegal character is a double quote inside a string that is surrounded by double quotes:

Example
You will get an error if you use double quotes inside a string that is 
surrounded by double quotes:

To fix this problem, use the escape character \":
