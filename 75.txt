Output Variables
The Python print statement is often used to output variables.
To combine both text and a variable, Python uses the 
+ character:

Example

x = "awesome"print("Python is " + x)

You can also use the + character to add a variable to another variable:

Example

x = "Python is "y = "awesome"z =  x + y
print(z)

For numbers, the + character works as a mathematical operator:

Example

x = 5y = 10print(x + y)

If you try to combine a string and a number, Python will give you an error:

Example

  x = 5y = "John"print(x + y)
