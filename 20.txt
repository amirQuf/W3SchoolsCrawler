An HTML link is displayed in a different color depending on 
whether it has been visited, is unvisited, or is active.

HTML Link Colors
By default, a link will appear like this (in all browsers):

An unvisited link is underlined and blue
A visited link is underlined and purple
An active link is underlined and red

You can change the link state colors, by using CSS:

Example
Here, an unvisited link will be green with no underline. A visited link 
will be pink with no underline. An active link will be yellow and underlined. 
In addition, when mousing over a link (a:hover) it will become red and underlined:

<style>a:link {  color: green;   background-color: transparent; 
    text-decoration: none;}
a:visited {  color: pink;  background-color: transparent;  
  text-decoration: none;}a:hover {  color: red;  background-color: transparent;
    text-decoration: underline;}
  a:active {  color: yellow;  background-color: transparent;  
  text-decoration: underline;}</style>
