Many Values to Multiple Variables
Python allows you to assign values to multiple variables in one line:

Example

  x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry"print(x)print(y)print(z)

Note: Make sure the number of variables matches the number of values, or else you will get an error.


One Value to Multiple Variables
And you can assign the same value to multiple variables in one line:

Example

  x = y = z = "Orange"print(x)print(y)print(z)

Unpack a Collection
If you have a collection of values in a list, tuple etc.
Python allows you extract the values into variables. This is called unpacking.


Example
Unpack a list:

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
x, y, z = fruits
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
