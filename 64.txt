Set Date methods let you set date values (years, 
months, days, hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds) for a Date Object.

Set Date Methods
Set Date methods are used for setting a part of a date:


Method
Description


setDate()
Set the day as a number (1-31)


setFullYear()
Set the year (optionally month and day)


setHours()
Set the hour (0-23)


setMilliseconds()
Set the milliseconds (0-999)


setMinutes()
Set the minutes (0-59)


setMonth()
Set the month (0-11)


setSeconds()
Set the seconds (0-59)


setTime()
Set the time (milliseconds since January 1, 1970)



The setFullYear() Method
The setFullYear() method sets the year of a date object. In this example to 2020:

Example

const d = new Date();
d.setFullYear(2020);

The setFullYear() method can optionally set month and day:

Example

const d = new Date();
d.setFullYear(2020, 11, 3);

The setMonth() Method
The setMonth() method sets the month of a date object (0-11):

Example

const d = new Date();
d.setMonth(11);

The setDate() Method
The setDate() method sets the day of a date object (1-31):

Example

const d = new Date();
d.setDate(15);

Try it Yourself »

The setDate() method can also be used to add days to a date:

Example

const d = new Date();
d.setDate(d.getDate() + 50);

Try it Yourself »


If adding days shifts the month or year, the changes are handled automatically by the Date object.


The setHours() Method
The setHours() method sets the hours of a date object (0-23):

Example

const d = new Date();
d.setHours(22);

Try it Yourself »


The setMinutes() Method
The setMinutes() method sets the minutes of a date object (0-59):

Example

const d = new Date();
d.setMinutes(30);

Try it Yourself »


The setSeconds() Method
The setSeconds() method sets the seconds of a date object (0-59):

Example

const d = new Date();
d.setSeconds(30);

Compare Dates
Dates can easily be compared.
The following example compares today's date with January 14, 2100:

Example

let text = "";
const today = new Date();
const someday = new Date();
 someday.setFullYear(2100, 0, 14);if (someday > today) {  text = "Today is before January 14, 2100.";} else {
    text = "Today is after January 14, 2100.";}

Try it Yourself »


JavaScript counts months from 0 to 11. January is 0. December is 11.
